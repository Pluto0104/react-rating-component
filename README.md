# React Rating

React Rating is a [react](https://github.com/facebook/react) rating component which supports custom symbols both with [inline styles](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html) and glyphicons found in popular CSS Toolkits like [Fontawesom](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/).

I intend to port the jQuery [bootstrap-rating](https://github.com/dreyescat/bootstrap-rating) to a React component.
